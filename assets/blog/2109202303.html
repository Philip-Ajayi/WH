    <div class="paragraph">Every human being possesses two legs, purposely for balance; it's deliberately made so because it's what we need as humans to make life's journey easier. Likewise, our faith life, which is needed to stand tall, is a leg on its own, and then we need something to make it balance, and <span class="highlight">PATIENCE</span> comes into the picture.</div>

    <div class="paragraph">People that stand in faith do not draw back; the journey can't be half-journeyed, why?? <span class="highlight">FAITH DOES NOT CANCEL PROCESS</span>.</div>

    <div class="quote">On what, then, should I stand?<br>"On Christ the solid Rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand."</div>

    <div class="paragraph">There are sinking sands; assumptions, wishes are typical examples. That it works doesn't mean it's God working. It might be your assumptions. Every believer should avoid building on this sand but on the <span class="highlight">AUTHENTICITY OF THE WORD</span>.</div>

    <div class="quote">"Standing on the promises that cannot fail,<br>when the howling storm of doubt and fear assail,<br>by the living <span class="highlight">WORD OF GOD I SHALL PREVAIL</span>. Standing on the promises of God"</div>

    <div class="paragraph"><span class="instructions">Why the WORD?</span>: Because that old serpent will definitely come to test the FOUNDATION OF A MAN’S FAITH, even Jesus didn’t escape it, but our Testimony is his victory.</div>

    <div class="instructions">How do I maintain my stand</div>

    <ul class="list">

        <li>Stand on the word. Affirm that it works because God is committed to what he says.</li>

        <li>Stand and ensure you're balanced. Remember you need patience to supplement your faith. Don't get weary in the waiting room.</li>

        <li>Strength: While waiting, generate strength through consistent and constant study of the word. Exercise is needed too, exercise your faith by <span class="highlight">SPEAKING WHAT YOU WANT (Prayer)</span> and by <span class="highlight">DOING THE WORD</span>.</li>

        <li>Support: Faith supports Faith. Associate with people whose faith can help yours, especially in trying times, people on whose shoulder you can rely on. But, do not build on theirs, build a solid Faith life for yourself.</li>

    </ul>

    <div class="paragraph">BELIEVING comes before RECEIVING. <span class="highlight">STAND ON IT and AFFIRM IT</span>.<br><span class="highlight">HAVE FAITH, SPEAK IN FAITH</span> and most importantly <span class="highlight">STAND FIRMLY ON IT</span>.</div>
