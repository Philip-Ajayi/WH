    <div class="bible-text">Hebrew 10:38-39, 11:1-3</div>
    <div class="song">When we walk with the Lord<br>In the light of his word<br>What a glory he sheds on our way.<br>While we do his Goodwill.<br>He abides with us still and with all who will trust and obey.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Every walk has a destination; however, no one can get to their destination without taking STEPS. It's never enough to hear from God, but the most important thing is to trust His instructions and obey them by taking steps towards the destination unknown to us but known to the OMNISCIENCE. By faith, Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going, for he was looking forward to the city with foundations whose architect and builder is God (Hebrew 11:8,10). Not just taking steps but taking steps in the direction of His instructions, taking steps in the direction of what we believe will happen.</div>
    <div class="quote">FAITH itself is an ACTION; we act because we believe that things will happen. The proof of a man’s FAITH is in the STEPS he takes; restricting oneself from taking steps is evidence of DOUBT. ANXIETY is proof of NO FAITH.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">However, our steps are ordered by His instructions which are not necessarily VERBAL (instructions gotten through the WORD) but can be through BODY LANGUAGE (sudden energy to do something, sudden interest in something). Just like He did with the Israelites, the presence of CLOUD in our brightest moment might be God saying something, likewise the PILLAR OF FIRE at the darkest hour, for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to His good purpose (Philippians 2:13).</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The faith walk, as previously said, can't be half-journeyed; we walk from faith to faith because there will always be a demand on our faith. FAITH is the OXYGEN we live on. Moreover, the faith walk isn't location-based, neither are God's instructions because the Author of the walk is the GOD OF THE HILL AND VALLEY, the GOD OF ALL LOCATIONS.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">It's simple, watch out for His INSTRUCTIONS not the WAVES.<br>His DIRECTION not the STORMS.<br>What He's SAYING over the rumbling sound of WATERS.<br>The proof of your FAITH is the STEP you take.</div>
